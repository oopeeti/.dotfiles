### Setup Requires
- True Color Terminal Like: [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (Version 0.8 or Later)
- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) - I use Hack Nerd Font
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - For Telescope Fuzzy Finder
- If working with typescript/javascript you need to install node.

If you're on mac, like me, you can install iTerm2, Neovim, Ripgrep and Node with homebrew.
```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```
```bash
brew install neovim
```
```bash
brew install ripgrep
```
```bash
brew install node
```
